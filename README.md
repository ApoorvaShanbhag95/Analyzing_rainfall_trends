Rainfall Trends in India Analysis:

Overview and Dataset

In this analysis, we aim to uncover long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in Indiaâ€™s rainfall data. We will examine historical rainfall trends, detect years with extreme or deficient rainfall, explore relationships between seasonal and annual rainfall, and forecast future rainfall using time series models.
Dataset Description

For this analysis, we rely on a dataset containing monthly, seasonal, and annual rainfall measurements spanning over a century. I found an ideal dataset for this task, which includes monthly rainfall values, seasonal aggregations (e.g., monsoon rainfall), and annual totals, all of which are essential for understanding variability, detecting anomalies, and predicting future trends

To understand the broader trends, we will plot three plots:

We will plot annual rainfall over time and compare it with the overall mean. This helps identify whether there is a noticeable long-term trend, such as an increase or decrease in rainfall over the years.
We will calculate the average rainfall for each month across all years. And by plotting a bar chart, we can identify the months with the highest and lowest average rainfall.
Next, we will analyze seasonal rainfall by aggregating rainfall data into four seasons: Jan-Feb, Mar-May, Jun-Sep (Monsoon), and Oct-Dec.
